Hello,

I was able to create the Frontend and Backend but was not able to deploy the Backend code.
It was showing 404 Not Found.

**SETUP:**
  1. git clone the directory into your local system **"git clone https://github.com/revanth-collab/Real-Time-chat-APP.git"**

     For Node.js:
       1. cd .\chat-app-backend\
       2. run the npm install
       3. node server.js

     For React.js:
       1. cd .\chat-app-frontend\
       2. run the npm install
       3. npm start

  make sure the mongodb is install and check the .env file
